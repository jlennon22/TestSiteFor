    <p>The ocean has a lot of different kinds of animals</p>
    <h2>Dolphins</h2>
    <p>There are several different kinds of dolphins and some, like the river dolphins, even live in fresh water. Although similar to whales, they are two different groups, both belonging to the infraorder Cetacea</p>
    <h2>Coral</h2>
    <p>You might be surprised to learn that coral is actually alive! They have a symbiotic relationship with single-cellular organisms inside of them which photosynthesize, giving them nutrition. These organisms also give them their beautiful color. Coral is increasingly at risk of dying because of rising sea temperatures, which also causes them to bleach their color.</p>
    <h2>Orca Whales</h2>
    <p>Orcas have been spotted in all the oceans across the world. Although they sometimes return to the same places each year, their migration patterns are not well understood. Despite their name, Orcas are actually dolphins, unlike whales such as blue whales.</p>
